2. Laravel Lumen 5.4 to design it backend;
3. Angular 1.6.1 to design it frontend;
4. Eloquent ORM to handle & itterate with database;
5. Blade Template Engine to construct a dynamic template;
6. SQL to design the database schema;

#### For what i use Chocolatey?

For development purposes and to create test and educational local Habbo.com website (CMS) clones.

#### How i can have a full experience with Chocolatey?

* **Chocolatey** is totally compatible with [Arcturus Emulator](http://arcturus.wf), an open-source Habbo Emulator. **Chocolatey** only support it.
* Also **Chocolatey** only supports php 7.0+ environments, php 5.X is no longer supported.

### Installation
#### Installing a Production version of Chocolatey is really easy

1. Download the latest **Chocolatey** release
2. Extract it to your web-server <i>htdocs/public_html/wwwwroot/www</i> folder.
3. Configure your `.env` file with your Database Credentials
4. Edit `config/chocolatey.php` with some <i>optional</i> stuff. (Some fields are really required)
5. To finally migrate the Chocolatey Database. Open your <i>Terminal/CMD/Console</i> on the Chocolatey folder And execute the following command.: `php artisan migrate`. **If all Database credentials are right, Chocolatey** will successfully deploy his Database.
6. Open your Browser and be Happy.

### Observations

#### Entering at Maintenance Mode
You can enter at the maintenance mode by opening your <i>Terminal/CMD/Console</i> on the Chocolatey folder and execute the following command.: `php artisan down`. This will enter the system in Maintenance Mode.

You actually can edit the white-list IP addresses by editing the `.env` file.

To get out from maintenance do the following command.: `php artisan up`.

#### Editing your Logo
Editing your Logo on **Chocolatey** it's a little more difficult. And because that we will release a Plugin that replaces the Habbo Logo by your logo on the Sprites file.
