        class="align-right"></p>

        class="align-right"></p>
<h4>Sell for real money</h4>
<p>Never sell your furni, account, password or anything in the game for real money. You will lose everything, plus you&apos;ll

<h4>Place or accept bets</h4>
<p>Using furni that randomizes games, with the possibility to place bets, might get you into trouble. Why leave it to
    chance? Just don&apos;t do it!</p>
